DMake (dxmake)
==============

DMake was written by [Matt Dillon](https://apollo.backplane.com/) to provide a
Make-like tool for his DICE product. DICE - Dillon's Interactive C
Environment - was a C compiler and tool suite for Commodore Amiga computers in
the 1980s and 1990s. In its later years it was open-sourced, albeit with a
non-standard "no commercial use" license.

In October 2023, Matt generously relicensed DICE and DMake under the well-known
BSD license, and I have uploaded it to this repository.

Matt describes DMake as follows:

> This is the DMAKE application, now called "dxmake" to avoid confusion with
> the "dmake" package which has nothing to do with my dmake. This is currently
> needed to compile up the DICE suite (though I expect anyone who really cares
> will redo the DICE suite to use bsd make or gmake).

This repository was created by [Richard Downer](https://richard.downer.tech/)
and I intend to maintain this and modernise it on an occasional basis. I can be
